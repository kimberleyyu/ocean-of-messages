    Welcome to Ocean of Messages, where you'll find a virtual ocean of thoughts and emotions awaiting! Here, you can write about anything on your mind -- happy stories, sad thoughts, urgent rants -- and drop them into a bottle, to be cast out into our sea and picked up by another across the world. Simply register to begin your journey~
</p>
<p>
    Once registered and logged in, you'll find yourself at the home page, where a vast and beautiful ocean of messages lies before you, the keen thinker ready to pick up or drop in a bottled message. Calming ocean music will fill your ears -- to turn it off, simply click the stop button at the top right of the ocean's sky.
</p>
<p>
    Now you have to make a choice: catch another's message, or write one? 
</p> 
<p>
    In our ocean, you'll see bottled messages drifting ashore. To catch one, simply grab your net at the top left corner of the ocean, labeled "Catch a bottle?", and a message will pop up before you. Read it, and understand the perhaps deep, emotional, or light-hearted thoughts of another. Then, choose to reply in the space below (kind thoughts only!) or throw the message back into the ocean for someone else to reply.
</p>
<p>
    To write your own message, simply grab your bottle and paper at the top right corner of the screen, labeled "Write a message?", and space to write your message will pop up before you. Feel free to say anything on your mind (but please no profanity!), whether you want to share a story, release your frustration, or spill out bottled secrets. Rest assured, all messages will drift across our ocean anonymously. 
</p>
<p>
    To check on your bottles, click the "My Bottles" icon above the ocean. Here, you'll find a list of all messages you've ever written, and whether they've been picked up and replied to by another person. Get ready to laugh, smile, and/or feel consoled when you read the replies to the bottles you've thrown out to sea.
</p>
<p>
    And that's about it! Click on the "Instructions" icon anytime to re-read these instructions, and change your password or log out by clicking on the icons at the top of the screen.
